### Step 1: Look for 'master-plan.md Create the `master-plan.md`
- This file will act as the high-level roadmap.
- It must not be changed after creation unless I explicitly instruct you to.
- It defines the core features and structure of the project.

### Step 2: Generate `granular-plan.md`
- Based strictly on the `master-plan.md`.

- Do not modify `master-plan.md` when checking off granular items.
