# üöÄ AutoCapture Master Plan

## üìã Project Overview
AutoCapture is an iOS application that captures subjects using advanced computer vision, removes backgrounds, and provides a visual editor for compositing with AI-generated backgrounds. The app targets professional photography workflows for automotive, real estate, restaurant, and small business industries.

## üéØ Core Features

### 1. Enhanced Camera & Capture System
- **Advanced Subject Detection**: Improved subject lift using specialized training data (800+ automotive photos)
- **Batch Capture**: Stock number/ID-based batch processing for vehicles, houses, restaurants
- **Subject Lift Toggle**: Option to capture full scenes or just subjects
- **Professional Camera Controls**: Manual focus, exposure, zoom, flash control
- **High-Quality Capture**: Optimized for iPhone 15 Pro+ with iOS 26+

### 2. Visual Editor & Compositing
- **Layer Management**: Multi-layer editing with forward/backward positioning
- **File Import Support**: JPEG, JPG, PNG, HEIF, SVG upload capabilities
- **Object Manipulation**: Move, scale, rotate objects within compositions
- **Real-time Preview**: Live editing with instant visual feedback

### 3. AI Background Generation System
- **Category-Based Prompts**: Structured prompts for different industries
  - Automotive (dealership showrooms)
  - Real Estate (interior/exterior spaces)
  - Restaurant (dining environments)
  - Small Business (retail spaces)
  - [Expandable categories]

- **Structured Prompt Templates**: Each category includes:
  - Subject description
  - Style specifications (photo-real, depth of field)
  - Lighting requirements
  - Camera settings (35mm, f/2.8, ISO 200, 1/125s)
  - Universal constraints (no text, people, logos, subjects, vehicles, foreground objects)
  - Quality standards (high detail, subtle film grain)

### 4. Storage & Data Management
- **Hybrid Storage Architecture**: 
  - Local storage for app data and testing
  - External storage for lifted subject images
  - Cloud sync for compositions and user data
- **Firebase Integration**: Authentication, storage, and user management
- **Batch Organization**: Stock number-based image grouping

### 5. User Authentication & Profiles
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure login/signup
- **User Profiles**: Personal settings and preferences
- **Cloud Sync**: Cross-device composition access
- **Subscription Management**: Premium features and usage limits

### 6. Community Features
- **Background Library**: Community-shared background images
- **Category Filtering**: Browse backgrounds by industry/type
- **Rating System**: Community-driven quality assessment
- **Sharing**: Export and share compositions
